\section{Concrete Implementations}

In this section, we define two concrete implementations of constraint stores which can be incorporated in operational semantics: the trivial one
(implementation A) and the one which is close to existing real implementation in a certain version of \textsc{miniKanren}~\cite{CKanren} (implementation B).

\subsection{Implementation A}

This trivial implementation simply stores all pairs of terms, which the search encounters, in a multiset and never uses them:

\[ \cstore_\sigma \subset_m \mathcal{T} \times \mathcal{T} \]

\[ \cstoreinit = \emptyset \]

\[ \csadd{\cstore_\sigma}{t_1}{t_2} = \cstore_\sigma \cup \{(t_1, t_2)\} \]

\[ \csupdate{\cstore_\sigma}{\delta} = \cstore_\sigma \]

The interpretation of such constraint store is the set of all representing functions that does not equate terms in any pair:

\[ \sembr{\cstore_\sigma} = \{\reprfun \colon \mathcal{A}\mapsto\mathcal{D} \mid \forall (t_1, t_2) \in \cstore_\sigma, \; \overline{\reprfun}\,(t_1) \neq \overline{\reprfun}\,(t_2)\} \]

This is a correct implementation (although for the full implementation we should find a way to present restrictions stored this way
in answers adequately) and it satisfies the sufficient conditions for completeness trivially, but it is not very practical.
In particular, it does not use information acquired
from disequalities to halt the search in case of contradiction and it can return meaningless answers with empty interpretations
(such as $([\alpha_0 \mapsto 5], [\alpha_0 \neq 5], 1)$).

We certified this implementation in \textsc{Coq}, which allowed us to extract a correct-by-construction interpreter for \textsc{miniKanren} with
disequality constraints.

\subsection{Implementation B}

This implementation is more similar to those in existing \textsc{miniKanren} implementations and takes an approach that is close to one described is~\cite{CKanren}.

In this version, every constraint is represented as a substitution containing variable bindings which should \emph{not} be satisfied.

\[ \cstore_\sigma \subset_m \Sigma \]

So if a constraint store $\cstore_\sigma$ contains a substitution $\omega$ the set of representing functions prohibited by it is $\sembr{\sigma \omega}$,
which provides the following denotational interpretation for a constraint store:

\[ \sembr{\cstore_\sigma} = \bigcap_{\omega \in \cstore_\sigma} \overline{ \sembr{\sigma \omega} } \]

We start with the empty store

\[ \cstoreinit = \emptyset \]

When we encounter a disequality for two terms we try to unify them and update constraint store depending on the result of unification:

\[
\csadd{\cstore_\sigma}{t_1}{t_2} =
    \begin{cases}
       \cstore_\sigma                                & \not\exists mgu(t_1 \sigma, t_2 \sigma) \\
       \bot                                                 & mgu(t_1 \sigma, t_2 \sigma) = \epsilon \\
       \cstore_\sigma \cup \{\omega\}      & mgu(t_1 \sigma, t_2 \sigma) = \omega \neq \epsilon
    \end{cases}
\]

If terms are not unifiable, there is no need to change the constraint store. If they are unified by current substitution the constraint is already violated and we signal fail.
Otherwise, the most general unifier is an appropriate representation of this constraint.

When updating constraint store with an additional substitution $\delta$ we try to update each individual constraint substitution by treating it
as a list of pairs of terms that should not be unified (the first element of each pair is a variable), applying $\delta$ to these terms and trying to
unify all pairs simultaniously:

\[ \cupdate{[x_1 \mapsto t_1, \dots, x_k \mapsto t_k]}{\delta} = mgu([\delta(x_1), \dots, \delta(x_k)],[t_1 \delta, \dots, t_k \delta]) \]

We construct the updated constraint store from the results of all constraint updates:

\[
\csupdate{\cstore_\sigma}{\delta} =
\begin{cases}
  \bot                                                 & \exists \omega \in \cstore_\sigma: \cupdate{\omega}{\delta} = \epsilon \\
  \{ \omega' \mid \cupdate{\omega}{\delta} = \omega' \neq \bot, \; \omega \in \cstore_\sigma \}   & \textit{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]

If any constraint is violated by the additional substitution we signal fail, otherwise we take in the store updated constraints
(and some constraints are thrown away as they can no longer be violated).

The sufficient conditions for completeness can be proven for this implementation too, but it requires a rigorous case analysis
and relies significantly on certain properties of substitutions constructed by \textsc{miniKanren} search, so by now we only have a pen-and-paper proof.
