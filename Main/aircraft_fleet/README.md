# The Range of a Fleet of Aircraft 


## Background

There is a fleet of N identical aircraft, where every aircraft has a fuel capacity of C liters and
fuel efficiency of R miles per liter of fuel. The fleet has a mission of reaching some target located
at a distance D from the airbase, where CR < D < NCR. Once taking off, there
is no more airbase along the way for the fleet to land and refuel. The fleet adopts such a  strategy that
at any stage, any one aircraft could be abandoned, whose fuel is simultaneously transferred to some fellow
aircraft. The mission is considered as successful if  at least
one aircraft  finally reaches the target. The typical behaviour of the fleet is like (read bottom-up):

```
            X   : Reaching the target
            ^
            |   : Action 1
          X X   : Action 2
          ^ ^
          | |   : Action 1
        X X X   : Action 2
        ^ ^ ^
        | | |   : Action 1

  X X X X X X   : Taking off from the airbase (initially six aircraft in the fleet).

Action 2 : Abandoning one aircraft, whose fuel is shared by the rest of the fleet.
Action 1 : Flying forward.

```

There are two problems of interest:
1. Given a fleet travel plan (which specifies how far the fleet shall fly together after taking off or
after some aircraft is abondoned, and how to distribute the fuel of the abandoned aircraft among the
rest of the fleet), how far can the fleet fly ?
1. Given a target distance, what shall the travel plan be for the fleet to reach the target, if possible?

The first problem is relatively easy. For instance, if we know that the plan is to let the fleet
fly forward until they all run out of fuel, then they can fly as far as a single aircraft.
We can even write a computer program to do the calculation for us, given the size of the fleet, the
fuel capacity and efficiency of the aircraft model, and the travel plan.


However, the second problem is less straightforward, and it may require some trial-and-error and creativity
to solve. We might do something like:  

"Oh, I got a plan, let's try it !"

"No it won't work."

"Then ... what about this modified plan?"

"Sorry, this won't work either !"

"Ok, let's see ... this one?"

" ... "

The gift of OCanren is that we can use it to write a program to solve the first problem, but the same piece of
 program can also solve the second problem for us without any modification. It works likes this: we define a
 relation: _steps(pre, acts, post)_ where _pre_ is a state of the fleet, _acts_ is a travel plan, and _post_ is
 the state of the fleet after executing the travel plan. To solve the first problem, we pose the query:
 _steps(initial_state, travel_plan, where?)_ and to solve to the second problem we pose the query:
 _steps(initial_state, what_plan?, desired_state)_.



## The Design of the Program

We adopt the following mathematical abstractions. 

### Discrete motion

For some arbitrary positive interger B, we take C/B liters as one unit of fuel
and take (RC)/B miles as one unit of distance, and say that an aircraft has a
maximum capacity of B units of fuel, and with which it can fly for B units of
distance at the most. We call B the _abstract capacity_ of an aircraft.

Moreover, we assume that an aircraft consumes fuel and covers distance in a discrete
(or unit-by-unit) and propotional manner, where one unit of fuel is consumed at
a time,  resulting in one unit of distance flied.

### Discrete fuel trasnfer 

Transfer of fuel within the fleet is also discrete:  only whole units
are allowed. For example, if an aircraft has 3 units of fuel left in the tank
that has a capacity of 5 units, then it can only refuel for 1 unit or 2 units.


### Picking an abstract capacity

Although the value of the abstract capacity B is arbitrarily picked, we must set it
to at least 2. If we set B = 1 then it would be impossible for the fleet to reach
the target (now B < D < NB), given our _discrete motion_ and _discrete fuel transfer_ assumptions.


For instance, B = 1 implies that the fleet would move forward for 1 unit of distance, 
running out of fuel and all aircraft abandoned.  If the fleet has two aircraft, and B = 2,
then there are  two possibilities:

1. The fleet flies for 2 units of distance, and then run out of fuel before reaching the target;
1. The fleet flies for 1 unit, then one aircraft is abandoned, transferring the fuel (1 unit) to the other, who
then continues to fly for 2 units. Thus the fleet achieves the range of 3 units.

### States of the fleet

A state of the fleet consists of the position of the fleet and a list of the amount of fuel
available for each aircraft in the fleet, called the _fuel profile_. Implicitly the fuel profile
shows how many aircraft are currently in the fleet: this is the length of the list.

**Example.** From the fuel profile `[5;5;5]` we can read that there are three aircraft
in the fleet and each has five units of fuel. If this fleet fly together for 3 units
of distance, the fuel profile would become `[2;2;2]`. Now if we abondon one aircraft (any one
is ok, for the result is the same), and give its fuel to the rest of the fleet, the possible
fuel profiles after the abandoning would be: `[2;4]`, `[3;3]` or `[4;2]`.

### Fleet actions

There are two possible actions of the fleet: flying forward (together), and abandoning
(with fuel sharing at the same time). A travel plan should be a list of actions as informative as possible,
for example, showing how far the fleet flies, and how the fuel is shared. Therefore we define
two action labels: `Forward(n)` and `Abandon([n1;...;nk])`. A initial state and a list of
action labels would allow us to compute the state when the actions have been executed.

**Example.** Let `(0, [5;5])` be the initial state, and `[Forward (2); Abandon ([5]);
Forward (5)]` be a list of actions. We could read that initially the fleet has two aircraft
and is at position 0. They would fly forward for 2 units of distance, then the state would be
(we are calculating by hand now) `[3;3]`. The next action is `Abandon([5])`, which means
that one aircraft is abandoned, and the new fuel profile of the fleet is `[5]`, which implies
that 2 units of fuel from the abandoned aircraft has been transferred to the remaining aircraft.
The final action is `Forward(5)` meaning the singleton fleet would fly forward for 5 units of
distance. Now there are no more fuel and the last aircraft is dropped, and the range the fleet
is collected from all `Forward` actions, that is 2 plus 5 equals 7.  

### Fleet state transition rules

## OCanren's Solution

Let B = 5 and OCanren suggested the following solutions
for fleets of various sizes to achieve certain ranges. In the
table, `Forward (x)` means that (all aircraft in) the fleet fly
forward for x units of distance; `Abandon([a1,...,an])` means that
 after abondoning one aircraft, the new state of the fleet is
`[a1,...,an]` where `a1,...,an` are fuel available for each aircraft
in the fleet and this takes into account of fuel transfer from the
single abandoned aircraft to the rest of the fleet. Without loss of generality, we always abandon the left
most aircraft in the list. It took about 10 mins to compute for the
6-aircraft fleet.

Fleet Size | Range | Moves
---        | ---   | ---
2          | 7     | [Forward (2); Abandon ([5]); Forward (5)] 
3          | 9     | [Forward (2); Abandon ([4; 5]); Forward (2); Abandon ([5]); Forward (5)] 
4          | 10    | [Forward (2); Abandon ([5; 4; 3]); Forward (1); Abandon ([4; 5]); Forward (2); Abandon ([5]); Forward (5)] 
5          | 11    | [Forward (1); Abandon ([5; 5; 5; 4]); Forward (1); Abandon ([5; 5; 5]); Forward (2); Abandon ([4; 5]); Forward (2); Abandon ([5]); Forward (5)] 
6          | 12    | [Forward (1); Abandon ([5; 5; 5; 5; 4]); Forward (1); Abandon ([5; 5; 5; 4]); Forward (1); Abandon ([5; 5; 5]); Forward (2); Abandon ([4; 5]); Forward (2); Abandon ([5]); Forward (5)]
