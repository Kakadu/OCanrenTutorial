## Tutorial Outline

We first take an appetizer of OCanren, using it to solve a cool puzzle:
 managing a fleet of aircraft. Then we study a "hello world" program,
 exposing various aspects of the technicalities of the language. In the third lesson, 
 we go deep down into the most important: understanding and defining 
 user types. After that, we will be positioned to write non-trivial relational programs, 
 where we define a simple relational data base, followed by a library for Peano numbers. 
 With all these experienced, the reader could head back to the appetizer and appreaciate 
 it from a more technical standpoint.
