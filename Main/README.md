## Tutorial Outline

We first take an _appetizer_ of OCanren, using it to solve a cool puzzle:
 managing a fleet of aircraft. Then we study a "hello world" program in OCanren,
 exposing various aspects of the technicalities of the language. In the third lesson, 
 we go deep down into the most important part of OCanren: understanding and defining 
 user types. After that, we will be positioned to write non-trivial relational programs, where we define 
 a relational data base and query about it. With all these experienced, the reader 
 could head back to the appetizer and appreaciate it from a technical standpoint.
