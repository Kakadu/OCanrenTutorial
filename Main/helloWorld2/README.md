# "Hello World!" Revisited


The [program](hello2.ml) that we study in this lesson is almost the
same as [the one](../helloWorld/hello.ml) of the previous lesson, except that the line:
```ocaml
let str = !!("hello world!\n");;
```
now becomes:
```ocaml
let str : String.groundi = !!("hello world!\n");;
```
where we have added a type decoration `String.groundi`, and before that we have inserted a block
of type definitions, notably the String module:
```ocaml
@type 'a logic' = 'a logic with show;;

module String = struct
  @type t = GT.string with show;;
  @type ground = t with show;;
  @type logic = t logic' with show;;
  type groundi = (ground, logic) injected;;
end;;
```
that shows how the type `String.groundi` of `str` is defined following the four-step routine.

In the String
module, the type `t` is at the abstract level, and the type `ground` is at the ground level,
`logic` at the logic level, and `groundi` at the injected level. In our example the abstract level
and the ground level coincide, but in general they are quite different, as we will see when working
with non-constant constructors of variant types.  

## The @type Syntax

In OCanren, type constructors are often defined by :
```
<type definition> ::= @type <typedef> with <plugins>

<plugins> ::= <plugin> { , <plugin> }

<plugin>  ::= show | gmap | <etc>
```
where the syntactic category `<typedef>` is the same as
[that](https://ocaml.org/releases/4.11/htmlman/typedecl.html) of OCaml. The most frequently used plugins
in OCanren are _show_ and _gmap_, providing for the defined type a string converson function
(like [Stdlib.string_of_int](https://ocaml.org/releases/4.11/htmlman/libref/Stdlib.html)) and
a structure preserving map function 
(a generalization of  [List.map](https://ocaml.org/releases/4.11/htmlman/libref/List.html))  respectively.


A type definition of the form `@type <typedef> with <plugins>` is expanded at the syntactic level
by GT into:
1) A type definition of the usual form `type <typedef>`, where the value of `<typedef>` is preserved, and
1) Several (auto-generated) plugin definitions.

## The `logic` Type

The `logic` type constructor occuring on the right hand side of the type equation:
```ocaml
@type 'a logic' = 'a logic with show;;
```
is provided by the
[Logic](../../Installation/ocanren/src/core/Logic.mli#L21) module
(included in the OCanren module). To define the string type at the logic level,
we need to alias the `Logic.logic` constructor as `logic'`. This is also a piece
of OCanren boilerplate.

## Summary

All types manipulated by OCanren are at the injected level, but to define such types
we need three other kinds of types which are said to be at the
_abstract_, _ground_ and _logic_ levels.
